Aiming for the MVP now...

* refactoring: extract header buttons into a separate TopRightNav component

2. order history
   * order history link on the order details page
3. user reviews/ratings
   * loading state for the review section
   * make 'sign in' button clickable
   * preserve newlines? full markdown? what?
5. server-side validation

* try this beautifier for tailwind and otherwise?

* login signup
   * 4-leter code input field should automatically submit upon reaching 4 letters, as we  don't have a  submit  button  there
   * give new users a random color for their avatars
   * server-side request validation
   * prettify emails we send to the users
   * auto-focus the first field with an error in it
   * maybe refactor login form screens into separate components?

* db
* server-side request validation
* deliver what's been ordered
* every input must have a label? for screenreaderss

* cleanup header/main width/padding responsiveness

* cart to order page transition
* any error causes the server to crash... this is uh... not ideal


* do we do user login now?
   * It's a non-essential feature though, the store should be perfectly functional without it
   * same for user reviews
      * and it's impossible to do the latter without the former, so...
   * 'my orders' page

* core functionality
   * send an email with the purchased stripes attached
   * refunds? later

* search/catalogue
      * clear filters btn

* DB
   * SQlite + prisma?
   * redis?
   * firebase?

* loading state
   * there's text selectable behind the grayedout areas... people (or screenreaders) might accidentally see!
   * cascading issues
      * might not be such a huge problem, since the parent component should
        generally load faster then the children (as they usually only get
        created after the parent has loaded)

* content
   * stripes
   * main page gallery

* looks
   * main menu active state
   * main page search

* server-side request validation
* validate forms with vuelidate or somethin
* cart: dropdowns can't handle more than 9, but it's possible to set more than than through the buttons elsewhere
* extract button styles into a separate class
? clear cart animation
? buttons instead of dropdowns in cart
? animate price changes in cart
? loading indicators on the images
* SALE/recommended/collections and such
* main page logo stripe?
* the top image loads too long on mobile, same for the fonts. What are we gonna do about it?
* makes all the logos uniform
* mention image authors in the gallery?
? typescript

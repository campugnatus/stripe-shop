В очередь, сукины дети! В очередь!

* SSL

* favicon
* the fuck's with the logo's font on mobile?
* get real email server
* re-import stripes from figma
* push all this to github
* deploy to the server

* use nginx for serving static files
   * in the meantime, we'll just serve everything with express.js
* product updates in the production database

* what's the source of truth for hostnames, port numbers, file paths used in the server?
   * docker-compose.yml?
   * hard-coded?
      * probably not the best idea, esp if they appear in more than one place

* spurious POST /cart on page load
* get /cart 'not logged in' fucks everything up
* put API and APP in separate directories?

* cart email address doesn't get filled in (thought it worked?)
* fix front page page title

* try this beautifier for tailwind and otherwise?

* extract shit into modules on the server

* off-price stripes
   * with a crack
   * with a dent
   * with a chip
   * with an abrasion

* make stripes on the frontpage hoverable (and clickable!)

* about
* third one
   * make them both clickable

* login signup
   * 4-leter code input field should automatically submit upon reaching 4 letters, as we  don't have a  submit  button  there
   * give new users a random color for their avatars
   * prettify emails we send to the users
   * auto-focus the first field with an error in it
   * maybe refactor login form screens into separate components?

* every input must have a label? for screenreaderss

* any error causes the server to crash... this is uh... not ideal

* loading state
   * there's text selectable behind the grayedout areas... people (or screenreaders) might accidentally see!
   * cascading issues
      * might not be such a huge problem, since the parent component should
        generally load faster then the children (as they usually only get
        created after the parent has loaded)

* content
   * stripes
   * main page gallery


* cart: dropdowns can't handle more than 9, but it's possible to set more than than through the buttons elsewhere
* extract button styles into a separate class
? clear cart animation
? buttons instead of dropdowns in cart
? animate price changes in cart
? loading indicators on the images
* SALE/recommended/collections and such
* main page logo stripe?
* the top image loads too long on mobile, same for the fonts. What are we gonna do about it?
* makes all the logos uniform
* mention image authors in the gallery?
? typescript

* 9 stripe

? make full-text search search among reviews, as well? or not?
? make a button to switch between AND and OR in the filters
? cart to order page transition

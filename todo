В очередь, сукины дети! В очередь!


--------------------------------------------
LATER

* front page redesign
* fake users/comments
   * avatars?

* there's no fucking SALE...
* browse our catalogue / shop stripes buttons

* push all this to github
   * secrets!
     * figma token is stored not securely in the code


* Send better emails
* sql migration management/automation

* server.js: extract email stuff into a separate module
* deploy rollback...
   * without docker hub that would be trivial
      * I'm sure there's a way

* meditate on the log format a little bit
* where to store deliverable .zips in prod? in a volume?
   * what about not storing them at all?
* bulk loading for products?
* password scrambling in logs?
   * for now there's no passwords in logs at all
* add <link rel="canonical"> to index.html
* ? upgrade vite to version 3

* flash of unstyled content?
* handle archived products
* GSAP scroll trigger sucks ass

* use nginx for serving static files
   * in the meantime, we'll just serve everything with express.js

* spurious POST /cart on page load
* put API and APP in separate directories?

* try this beautifier for tailwind and otherwise?

* extract shit into modules on the server

* off-price stripes
   * with a crack
   * with a dent
   * with a chip
   * with an abrasion

* make stripes on the frontpage hoverable (and clickable!)

* login signup
   * 4-leter code input field should automatically submit upon reaching 4 letters, as we  don't have a  submit  button  there
   * give new users a random color for their avatars
   * prettify emails we send to the users
   * auto-focus the first field with an error in it
   * maybe refactor login form screens into separate components?

* every input must have a label? for screenreaderss

* any error causes the server to crash... this is uh... not ideal

* loading state
   * there's text selectable behind the grayedout areas... people (or screenreaders) might accidentally see!
   * cascading issues
      * might not be such a huge problem, since the parent component should
        generally load faster then the children (as they usually only get
        created after the parent has loaded)

* content
   * stripes
   * main page gallery


* cart: dropdowns can't handle more than 9, but it's possible to set more than than through the buttons elsewhere
* extract button styles into a separate class
? clear cart animation
? buttons instead of dropdowns in cart
? animate price changes in cart
? loading indicators on the images
* SALE/recommended/collections and such
* main page logo stripe?
* the top image loads too long on mobile, same for the fonts. What are we gonna do about it?
* makes all the logos uniform
* mention image authors in the gallery?
? typescript

* 9 stripe

? make full-text search search among reviews, as well? or not?
? make a button to switch between AND and OR in the filters
? cart to order page transition

Once more, what's the next BIG thing???

* do we do user login now?
   * It's a non-essential feature though, the store should be perfectly functional without it
   * same for user reviews
      * and it's impossible to do the latter without the former, so...
   * 'my orders' page

* core functionality
   * send and email with the purchased stripes attached
   * 'download the items ordered' button on the order's page?
   * refunds? later

* search/catalogue
   * filters (maybe later?)
      * clear filters btn

* DB
   * mongo?
   * firebase?
* loading state
   * there's text selectable begind the grayedout areas... people might accidentally see! or screenreaders. they can see
   * there's parts visible for screen readers that shouldn't be
   * cascading issues
      * might not be such a huge problem, since the parent component should
        generally load faster then the children (as they usually only get
        created after the parent has loaded)
* main page gallery rework?
* typescript
* server-side request validation
* update order status in real time... websockets or something?
* validate forms with vuelidate or somethin
* footer
* in carousel the shadow doesn't appear before you jiggle it a little
? partially filled stars
* cart: dropdowns can't handle more than 9, but it's possible to set more than than through the buttons elsewhere
* take button styles into a separate class
? clear cart animation
? buttons instead of dropdowns in cart
? animate price changes in cart
? loading indicators on the images
* SALE/recommended/collections and such
* main page logo stripe?
* dragging of the gallery
* the top image loads too long on mobile, same for the fonts. What are we gonna do about it?
* makes all the logos uniform
* mention image authors in the gallery?

В очередь, сукины дети! В очередь!

* page load times
* stripe update procedure in prod

* spam
   * our emails seem to end up in spam on gmail
      * fuck! I hoped we were past that!

* deployment
   * I'm not happy with the half-manual setup we have. It's brittle and poorly documented

* tests :-O

* what do I do with SMTP server in the stagin environment?
   * just use mailtrap
   * package exim with the app

* auth
   * are we sure user can't do anything harmful before having verified email?
   * how can we filter bots/idiots?

* SSG: server-side generation
   * Nuxt?
   * vite ssg plugin? <- i'm leaning toward this

* investigate and probably turn on SQLite WAL mode

* no-text reviews show up in the comments count on the product card
* if google pay fails to load, show something in its stead

* review form mobile layout
* 'load more' on mobile leaves you on the bottom of the page

* front page redesign

* fake users/comments
   * avatars?

* there's no fucking SALE...
* browse our catalogue / shop stripes buttons


* Send better emails
* sql migrations management/automation

* deploy rollback...
   * without docker hub that would be trivial
      * I'm sure there's a way

* meditate on the log format a little bit
* bulk loading for products?
* password scrambling in logs?
   * for now there's no passwords in logs at all
* add <link rel="canonical"> to index.html

* flash of unstyled content?
* handle archived products
   * like, what happens if the user has bought something and those products
     got changed/removed from the shop after that?
* GSAP scroll trigger sucks ass

* use nginx for serving static files
   * in the meantime, we'll just serve everything with express.js

* spurious POST /cart on page load
* put API and APP in separate directories?

* maybe try this beautifier for tailwind and otherwise?

* extract shit into modules on the server

* off-price stripes ideas
   * with a crack
   * with a dent
   * with a chip
   * with an abrasion

* login signup
   * 4-leter code input field should automatically submit upon reaching 4 letters, as we  don't have a  submit  button  there
   * give new users a random color for their avatars
   * prettify emails we send to the users
   * auto-focus the first field with an error in it
   * maybe refactor login form screens into separate components?

* every input must have a label? for screenreaderss

* any error causes the server to crash... this is uh... not ideal

* loading state
   * there's text selectable behind the grayedout areas... people (or screenreaders) might accidentally see!
   * cascading issues
      * might not be such a huge problem, since the parent component should
        generally load faster then the children (as they usually only get
        created after the parent has loaded)

* content
   * stripes
   * main page gallery


* cart: dropdowns can't handle more than 9, but it's possible to set more than than through the buttons elsewhere
* extract button styles into a separate class
? clear cart animation
? buttons instead of dropdowns in cart
? animate price changes in cart
? loading indicators on the images
* SALE/recommended/collections and such
* the top image loads too long on mobile, same for the fonts. What are we gonna do about it?
* makes all the logos uniform
* mention image authors in the gallery?
? typescript

* 9 stripe

? make full-text search search among reviews, as well? or not?
? make a button to switch between AND and OR in the filters
? cart to order page transition




* I feel we need more play with the longest stripe
   * a place where it fills up the background behind some white-on-white message
   * something with a lot of wiggles...
   * spirals in the gallery
   * breaking into many small stripes and reassembling again?
* do we abandon the idea of the longest stripe going from the top to the gallery?
* how exactly to do "in ..." titles?

Okay, but what's the next BIG thing?

* do we do user login now?
   * It's a non-essential feature though, the store should be perfectly functional without it
   * same for user reviews
      * and it's impossible to do the latter without the former, so...

* do we begin with the server?
   * db?
      * search
      * pagination
      * loading products on demand
   * let's ask ourselves the following question: what else (of any significance) can we do WITHOUT a server?

* core functionality
   * send and email with the purchased stripes attached
   * 'download the items ordered' button on the order's page?
   * simulate some action for status updates
      * what are those? Let's go with the following for now:
         * created -> (send email?) -> waiting for payment -> paid -> shipped (send email with the stripes)
            * let's do that FOR NOW
         * refunds?
            * let's deal with them later

* search
   * simultaneous searches?
   * while searching, do we keep showing the previous results, or the loading state?
   * update url
   * prefetch somthn
   * loading state: dislpay something appropriate
   * sorting yo
   * filters (maybe later?)
   * nothing found state
   * don't show 'load more' when there's no more

* product page loading state
* load FIRST, THEN redirect? youtube does it this way
* search box text doesn't stay there after redirect
* there's text selectable begind the grayedout areas... people might accidentally see! or screenreaders. they can see
* typescript
* server-side request validation
* refunds?
* update order status in real time... websockets or something?
* fetchProducts and all that
* validate forms with vuelidate or somethin
* back to top button
* catalogue filters
   * i think this requires server/db/search
* footer
* grayout style/animation
* in carousel the shadow doesn't appear before you jiggle it a little
* preload shit before navigation to a page (like they do in vue-hackernews for example)
- carousel mock data
- draggables: listen to mousemove/mouseup on the document
? partially filled stars
* something something header... yeah, well, now I don't even remember what I meant by that
* cart: dropdowns can't handle more than 9, but it's possible to set more than than through the buttons elsewhere
- mobile cart button in the header
* DB
   * mongo?
   * firebase?
* 'my orders' page
* user login and shit
* take button styles into a separate class
? clear cart animation
- cart counter on the main page
- add to cart button on the warecards
? buttons instead of dropdowns in cart
? animate price changes in cart
- prevent CLICK when dragging in the carousel
- clear cart confirmation
   - or just make an undo button?
- cart item removal animation
* loading indicators on all the images
- cart! Almost forgot about it
* "load more" in the catalogue
* SALE section on the main page must display some stripes, uh... that are on sale?
- curated order of stripes
- show product info on the product page
* main page logo stripe?
- load the actual stripes and display them in the catalogue
* dragging of all the horizontal elements
* the top image loads too long on mobile, same for the fonts. What are we gonna do about it?
* makes all the logos uniform
* mention image authors in the gallery?
